# Sensor Fusion Specialization Projects

Projects introducing the concept of sensor fusion, from learning how to process three types of car sensor types: 

* [Lidar](https://github.com/caiomiyashiro/sensor_fusion_specialization/tree/main/1_Lidar): Process point clouds to segment, clusterize and estimate distances. Final project involved process a short video of point cloud and clusterize all objects in the scene.

* [Camera](https://github.com/caiomiyashiro/sensor_fusion_specialization/tree/main/2_Camera): Tutorials on point detection, description and matching using OpenCV to track individual objects through and video scene and estimate their distance using the image's size variation.

* [Radar](https://github.com/caiomiyashiro/sensor_fusion_specialization/tree/main/3_Radar): How radar perceives the world and distance, angle and speed estimations using Doppler Response and Constant false alarm rate - CFAR.

and to fuse all of their informations to produce final more reliable estimates with
  
* [Unscented Kalman Filter](https://github.com/caiomiyashiro/sensor_fusion_specialization/tree/main/4_Kalman_Filters): What are kalman filters, how to process the two steps of predict and estimate, what are extended kalman filters and their linearization process and, finally, what are unscented kalman filters.
